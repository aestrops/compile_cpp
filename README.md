# compile_cpp
c++ compiling program using clang++

THIS PROGRAM WILL DELETE ANY FILE WHICH HAS THE SAME NAME AS YOUR .CPP FILE (minus the .cpp). this way it can name the unix executable your .cpp file without the .cpp. therefore, if it says something along the lines of "rm error: cannot locate file", it's normal and doesn't mean anything is broken. this program works on arm as well as normal intel cpus. idk if it works on a windows terminal but it does work on linux and similar terminals. you have to have clang++ installed on your computer to run this.
